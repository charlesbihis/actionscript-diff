This is a port from the Java implementation of the algorithm as is provided by the [google-diff-match-patch project](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) written by Neil Fraser of Google.\r\n\r\nThis project was first mentioned in my blog post at http://blogs.adobe.com/charles/2011/12/diff-library-for-actionscript.html.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nThe ActionScript Diff Library supports the following features...\r\n\r\n* Simple API to interact with the diff algorithm\r\n* Returns diff boundaries of letters which have changed, and letters which haven't\r\n* Pure AS3 implementation (no Flex SDK required)\r\n* Documentation!\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [as3corelib](https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib)\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the library, simply drop in the SWC (or the source) into your project, along with the appropriate dependencies, and follow the usage below...\r\n\r\n\tvar diffs:Array = new Diff().diff(beforeText.text, afterText.text);\r\n\r\nThe result that you get back is an Array of the different operations that it took to go from the original string to the modified string. You can easily use this to display the differences in whatever way you want.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n* Live demo: http://blogs.adobe.com/charles/2011/12/diff-library-for-actionscript.html\r\n* Demo source: https://github.com/charlesbihis/sandbox/tree/master/actionscript/actionscript-diff-demo\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can find the full ASDocs for the project [here](http://charlesbihis.github.com/actionscript-diff/docs/).\r\n\r\n### Relevant\r\n\r\n* \"An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations\" by Eugene W.
